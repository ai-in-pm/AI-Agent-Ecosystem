Design an innovative algorithm for a robust AI Agent Ecosystem that integrates all major Frontier LLMs, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Mistral, Ollama, and Groq. This ecosystem must include an AI Agent Generator capable of dynamically creating specialized agents based on user-defined parameters. The ecosystem must autonomously execute, monitor, and optimize its operations to trend in the consumer market and achieve a monthly income of $500 within the first two weeks while scaling revenue month over month. Include detailed steps for launch, autonomous workflows, and 11 specialized AI agents with specific responsibilities. Ensure these agents are capable of real-time monitoring, collaborative improvement, and autonomous execution to meet and exceed performance goals.

Core Goals
Initial Income Target: Generate $500 in monthly revenue within the first two weeks of launch.
Scalability: Achieve a consistent monthly revenue increase of 20–30%.
Market Trend: Ensure the ecosystem trends within an hour of launch and sustains consumer interest.
Optimization: Continuously adapt based on real-time performance data to maximize ROI and user satisfaction.
